# Journal - Week 1 (April 28 - May 4, 2025)

## April 29, 2025

### What I Did Today: 
- Finished setting up github.
- Put finishing touches on Jupyter notebook and git bash.

### Challenges:
- Had major difficulties configuring gitbash to github.
- Jupyter notebook crashed on me so I had to fully reset it ( not all the previous files i had in it of course) but I was required to re-install it if I wanted to be able to use it.
 
### What I Learned:
- Learned basic Git commands and Python setup.

### Goals For Tomorrow: 
- Learn Python basics: variables, loops.

### Todays Goal:
- Start python basics (variables, print, data types, if/else functions).

### What I Did Today
-  Today, I used ChatGPT to discover helpful websites for learning how to code. After some research, I found w3schools and it seemed like a good resource, so I've started using it to study Python.

### Challenges
- Today was indeed a pretty chill day, and while I didn't encounter many challenges, figuring out how global variables worked proved to be a bit of a hassle, taking up more of my time than anything else. However, it was definitely worth it because I currently feel like an expert on the topic and am very proud of my persistence in overcoming that learning curve.

### What I Learned:
- On w3schools, I learned about Python syntax, comments, variables, variable names, how to assign multiple values, output variables, global variables, and some fundamental Python data types.
- After finishing up with all of those materials, I decided to take the website's quiz for the section. It went well, and getting almost all of the questions correct shows that I retained the information I learned over the hour effectively. I also had ChatGPT create some coding quizzes and practice exercises for me, allowing for extended practice beyond what the website offers.

### Goals For Tomorrow:
- Continue learning Python Basics

## May 1, 2025
### Todays Goal:
- Continue my education in python basics

### What I Did Today
- I decided to change gears from my previous goal of making a planet sun orbit simulator. This is because I will eventually make one but it most likely will not be this summer. This is becasue instead of trying to rush through learning all of python so I can make one project and be done with it seems kind of fake to me. I want to have a deep understanding of this language becasue it will benefit me once I become an astrophysicist. So my goal for this summer alone is to completely learn python. well maybe not all of python but at least a good chunk of it. I will make mini projects here and there throughout my learning process and I will post them here on github. my goal for next school year is to get really good with physics. I am taking physics honors this upcoming school year as well as algebra 2 honors. I plan to take advanced placement physics in my junior year of highschool or to switch from physics honors to advanced placement physics as It will benefit my personal plans of projects I may want to complete in the future and I wont have to self learn everything. Anyways thats what I did today, as well as research better programs for learning pythons.

### Goals Fort Tomorrow:
- Continue learning Python

## May 2, 2025
### Todays Goal: 
- Learn some more python

### What I Did Today
- Not much was done. I wasn't very productive as it is a friday but that is no excuse.
- This Brocode guy on Youtube is perfect and is litterally helping me so much with learning I love his course he has on Python if anyone reading this plans to learn Python I highly reccomend Brocode
- I did a solid amount of practice on some more data types getting that all engrained into my head

### Challenges
- I struggled with getting some good coding time becasue I was struggling with concentration I don't know why though because I sat in my chair and listened the whole time but I had to rewatch the same video like 5 times to get it into my head for good.

### Goals For Tomorrow:
- Continue learning Python
- I want to get a solid two hours in becasue its the weekend
- study for my ap exam maybe idk ap human is so boring
