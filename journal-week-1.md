# Journal - Week 1 (April 28 - May 5, 2025)

## April 29, 2025

### What I Did Today: 
- Finished setting up github.
- Put finishing touches on Jupyter notebook and git bash.

### Challenges:
- Had major difficulties configuring gitbash to github.
- Jupyter notebook crashed on me so I had to fully reset it ( not all the previous files i had in it of course) but I was required to re-install it if I wanted to be able to use it.
 
### What I Learned:
- Learned basic Git commands and Python setup.

### Goals For Tomorrow: 
- Learn Python basics: variables, loops.

### Todays Goal:
- Start python basics (variables, print, data types, if/else functions).

### What I Did Today
-  Today, I used ChatGPT to discover helpful websites for learning how to code. After some research, I found w3schools and it seemed like a good resource, so I've started using it to study Python.

### Challenges
- Today was indeed a pretty chill day, and while I didn't encounter many challenges, figuring out how global variables worked proved to be a bit of a hassle, taking up more of my time than anything else. However, it was definitely worth it because I currently feel like an expert on the topic and am very proud of my persistence in overcoming that learning curve.

### What I Learned:
- On w3schools, I learned about Python syntax, comments, variables, variable names, how to assign multiple values, output variables, global variables, and some fundamental Python data types.
- After finishing up with all of those materials, I decided to take the website's quiz for the section. It went well, and getting almost all of the questions correct shows that I retained the information I learned over the hour effectively. I also had ChatGPT create some coding quizzes and practice exercises for me, allowing for extended practice beyond what the website offers.

### Goals For Tomorrow:
- Continue learning Python Basics
