# Summer_Project_2025
This is my personal passion project for this upcoming summer as a freshmen in high school and an aspiring astrophysicist
# Will Boyd's Summer 2025 Physics Projects

## Overview
This repository contains all the work I will be doing over the summer of 2025 as I explore astrophysics and physics concepts. I'll be focusing on:
- **Learning Python** for astrophysics projects.
- **Building a gravity simulator**.
- **Analyzing light curves** from the Kepler and TESS missions to find exoplanets.( if i get to this idk if i feel like doing this atm maybe next year lol when im better at python)
  
## Goals
- Learn basic Python coding and apply it to physics simulations.
- Complete a few projects to strengthen my comprehention of python.
- Next summer do some type of space related project
- this summer do some python projects anything that I learn or code will be input here. 
## Structure
- `Python_Learning/` - Contains all Python code and notebooks.
- `Gravity_Simulator/` - Contains all the files related to simulating gravity between planets.
  
( this entire project is going to be self educated and i will use many different tools to educate myseslf such as AI, a college text book I obtained from my odler sister, youtube, nasa, ect...)
